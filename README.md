Project TitleL: 
    On This Day in Space

Installation: None 

Motivation: 
   Is COVID bordem a problem in your life? Do you ever wonder what is happening in space on any given day? Did any space launches happen around the world?  Then On This Day in Space is the application for you! Put in any day and month and recieve a NASA backed photo and see if there was a space launch! Our motivation for the application came from a deep love of space, NASA and being able to create somethign that could cause even a small moment of distraction from... well... everything. So give it a try and see what space was doing on a date special to you or just a random day. 

 User Story:  
 AS A user ( this application is not only directed to one specific user but anyone who would like to use it)
 I WANT to see a photograph from that day in space and launch data if there is any
 SO THAT I can see photos of space and know if there were launches


Concepts: 
-Bulma was used for our CSS Framework. We also used JavaScript, jQuery, and 2 APIs (Nasa and Launch Library)
-Aaron Parnell and Ilya Libershteyn handled the back end of the project and Rowan Oliver, Erickson Powell, and Lauren Plenger handled the front end.
-The main challenge that we faced in this project was our image carousel. It was a new element for most of us and figuring out how to get the information from the APIs to display and function properly took a lot of collaboration and effort on everyoneâ€™s part.
-We turned the carousel from a challenge into a success and created the code for it from scratch. The teamwork and collaboration seemed to flow effortlessly and everyone showed up willing to work hard on this at every meeting.
